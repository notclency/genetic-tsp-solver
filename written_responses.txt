Question 1:
For a problem with 100 cities, how long would it take to exhaustively examine every possible route?
State your assumptions and explain how you arrived at your answer.

- For a problem with 100 cities, there are (100-1)! = 99! possible routes, assuming we fix the starting city.
  This is because we have 99 choices for the second city, 98 for the third, and so on.

Question 2:
What can you say about the time complexity of your approach? (ignore the time limit)

- The time complexity is primarily determined by the genetic algorithm (GA). With the nearest neighbor being O(n^2)
  and used to partially initialize the population, this massively reduces the runtime. With a fixed population
  size and generations, the time complexity will be O(n) and the genetic operations (crossover and mutation
  being less than O(n^2)). Overall, the time complexity approximates to O(generations * population_size * n^2),
  where 'n' is the number of cities.

Question 3:
If your program was seen as an "agent program", which of the agent types discussed in class would it be?

- Based on the agent types we have discussed in class, the program would be classified as a learning agent,
  as since we use a genetic algorithm it learns and evolves over generations to improve the solution based on
  the fitness function.
